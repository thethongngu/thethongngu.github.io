# Migration to Astro + Tailwind

Your static website has been successfully migrated from vanilla HTML/CSS to Astro with Tailwind CSS.

## What's Changed

### Technology Stack
- **From**: Static HTML files with custom CSS
- **To**: Astro static site generator with Tailwind CSS

### File Structure
```
src/
├── layouts/
│   └── BaseLayout.astro    # Shared layout with header, nav, footer
├── pages/
│   ├── index.astro         # Homepage
│   ├── about.astro         # About page
│   ├── projects.astro      # Projects page
│   ├── notes.astro         # Notes page
│   └── comic.astro         # Comics page
└── components/
    └── ComicCarousel.astro # Comic carousel component

public/
└── assets/                 # Static assets (moved from ./assets)
```

### Features Preserved
- All original styling and appearance
- Tagline hover effect ("life is about maximizing..." → "by building stupid things...")
- Header click navigation to homepage
- Comic carousel with pagination and navigation
- Responsive design
- Monospace typography (JetBrains Mono, Fira Code)

### New Features
- Component-based architecture
- TypeScript support
- Modern build system
- Optimized assets and performance
- Hot reload during development

## Development Commands

```bash
# Install dependencies (you'll need to run this first)
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build
npm run preview
```

## Deployment

The site is configured for automatic deployment to GitHub Pages via GitHub Actions. When you push to the main branch, it will:
1. Build the Astro site
2. Deploy to GitHub Pages

Make sure to:
1. Run `npm install` first to install dependencies
2. Enable GitHub Pages in repository settings
3. Set source to "GitHub Actions"

## Old Files

The original HTML files and CSS are still present but no longer used. You can safely delete:
- `index.html`, `about.html`, `projects.html`, `notes.html`, `comic.html`
- `style.css`
- `public/assets/shared.js` (functionality moved to BaseLayout.astro)

The Astro version is now your active website.
